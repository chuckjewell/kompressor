# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose of Kompressor

Kompressor is an innovative AI-assisted code management system designed to bridge the gap between traditional software development practices and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Its primary purpose is to enhance code organization, streamline documentation processes, and optimize interactions with AI assistants like Claude or GPT.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

As codebases grow in size and complexity, developers face challenges in maintaining a comprehensive understanding of their projects. Additionally, leveraging AI assistants for code-related tasks often requires providing sufficient context, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Kompressor aims to address these issues by creating a seamless interface between codebases and LLMs.

## 1.3 Key Objectives

1. Consolidate entire codebases into LLM-friendly formats
2. Automate and standardize documentation processes
3. Facilitate efficient, context-aware interactions with LLMs for code-related tasks
4. Integrate with existing development workflows and tools
5. Enhance code quality and maintainability through AI-assisted insights
