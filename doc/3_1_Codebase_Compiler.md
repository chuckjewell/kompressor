# 3.1 Codebase Compiler

## 3.1.1 Purpose

The Codebase Compiler is a core component of Kompressor, designed to scan, analyze, and consolidate an entire project codebase into a format optimized for LLM processing. Its primary goal is to create a comprehensive, context-rich representation of the codebase that can be easily understood and manipulated by AI models.

## 3.1.2 Key Features

1. Recursive Directory Traversal
2. Configurable File Type Filtering
3. Structured Output Generation
4. AI-Friendly Formatting
5. Metadata Extraction and Inclusion

## 3.1.3 Detailed Specifications

### 3.1.3.1 Recursive Directory Traversal

- Implement a depth-first search algorithm for efficient directory traversal
- Handle symlinks and circular references to prevent infinite loops
- Provide options for inclusion/exclusion of specific directories

### 3.1.3.2 Configurable File Type Filtering

- Support wildcard patterns for file extension filtering (e.g., *.py, *.js)
- Allow custom file type definitions based on content or naming conventions
- Implement an ignore file system (similar to .gitignore) for excluding specific files or directories

### 3.1.3.3 Structured Output Generation

- Generate a standardized header for each file, including:
  - File path
  - File type
  - Last modification date
  - Author (if available from version control)
- Create a hierarchical structure that mirrors the project's directory structure
- Include relevant README content alongside code files

### 3.1.3.4 AI-Friendly Formatting

- Develop a custom markdown-based format for representing the codebase
- Include clear delineation between different files and sections
- Implement syntax highlighting hints for improved LLM code understanding

### 3.1.3.5 Metadata Extraction and Inclusion

- Extract relevant metadata from files (e.g., function definitions, class structures)
- Include version control information (commit history, branches) where applicable
- Incorporate project-specific metadata (e.g., dependencies, build instructions)

## 3.1.4 Input and Output

- Input: Root directory of the project
- Output: A single, structured text file containing the entire codebase representation

## 3.1.5 Performance Considerations

- Implement caching mechanisms to avoid unnecessary recompilation of unchanged files
- Use streaming techniques for handling large codebases to minimize memory usage
- Provide options for incremental updates to the compiled output

## 3.1.6 Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling for file access issues, parsing errors, and unexpected file types
- Provide clear error messages and logging for troubleshooting
- Allow the compilation process to continue even if individual files fail, with appropriate warnings

## 3.1.7 Future Enhancements

- Integration with code analysis tools for enhanced metadata extraction
- Support for plugin systems to allow custom processing of specific file types
- Implementation of differential updates for faster processing of large codebases
