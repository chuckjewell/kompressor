# 3.3 LLM Interaction Module

## 3.3.1 Purpose

The LLM Interaction Module serves as the interface between the compiled codebase and Large Language Models (LLMs). It facilitates AI-assisted development tasks by managing the communication, context provision, and response processing between the Kompressor system and LLMs.

## 3.3.2 Key Features

1. Context-aware Code Querying
2. LLM API Integration
3. Query Parsing and Intent Recognition
4. Response Formatting and Presentation
5. Task-specific Interaction Modes

## 3.3.3 Detailed Specifications

### 3.3.3.1 Context-aware Code Querying

- Develop algorithms to extract relevant code snippets and documentation based on user queries
- Implement a sliding context window to manage large codebases within LLM token limits
- Create methods for maintaining conversation history and context across multiple queries

### 3.3.3.2 LLM API Integration

- Implement support for multiple LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude)
- Develop a modular design to easily add support for new LLM APIs
- Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms for API failures or quota limits

### 3.3.3.3 Query Parsing and Intent Recognition

- Design a natural language processing system to understand user intentions
- Implement keyword and phrase matching for common development tasks
- Develop a system for handling ambiguous queries and requesting clarification

### 3.3.3.4 Response Formatting and Presentation

- Create a flexible output formatter to present LLM responses in a user-friendly manner
- Implement syntax highlighting and code formatting for code snippets in responses
- Develop methods for breaking down long responses into digestible sections

### 3.3.3.5 Task-specific Interaction Modes

- Implement specialized modes for common tasks:
  - Code explanation
  - Refactoring suggestions
  - Bug detection and fixing
  - Documentation generation
  - Test case creation
- Develop appropriate prompts and response handling for each mode

## 3.3.4 Input and Output

- Input: User queries, compiled codebase, current development context
- Output: Formatted LLM responses, suggested code changes, explanations, or other task-specific results

## 3.3.5 Integration with Other Components

- Coordinate with the Codebase Compiler to access the latest compiled codebase
- Interface with the Document Generator for documentation-related tasks
- Communicate with the Test Management System for test-related queries and suggestions

## 3.3.6 User Interaction

- Provide a CLI interface for querying and interacting with the LLM
- Implement an interactive mode for multi-turn conversations
- Offer options for saving, reviewing, and applying LLM suggestions

## 3.3.7 Performance and Optimization

- Implement caching mechanisms for frequent queries to reduce API calls
- Develop strategies for breaking down large queries into manageable chunks
- Optimize context selection to maximize relevance while minimizing token usage

## 3.3.8 Security and Privacy

- Implement measures to prevent sensitive information from being sent to LLM APIs
- Provide options for using local LLMs to maintain code privacy
- Develop a system for anonymizing code snippets when necessary

## 3.3.9 Future Enhancements

- Integration with code editors and IDEs for seamless in-editor AI assistance
- Implementation of a learning system to improve context selection and query understanding over time
- Development of a graphical user interface for more intuitive interaction with the LLM
