# 2. System Overview

## 2.1 High-Level Architecture

Kompressor is designed as a modular system with several interconnected components. The high-level architecture consists of:

1. Codebase Compiler
2. Document Generator
3. LLM Interaction Module
4. Test Management System
5. Version Control Integration

These components work together to create a comprehensive code management and AI interaction system.

## 2.2 System Flow

1. The Codebase Compiler scans and consolidates the project files.
2. The Document Generator creates and updates README files throughout the project structure.
3. The LLM Interaction Module facilitates communication between the compiled codebase and LLMs.
4. The Test Management System integrates with the development process to suggest and generate tests.
5. The Version Control Integration ensures documentation remains in sync with code changes.

## 2.3 Key Features

- Unified codebase representation for LLM processing
- Automated, hierarchical documentation generation
- Context-aware code querying and analysis
- AI-assisted test case generation and refinement
- Seamless integration with existing version control systems

## 2.4 Technology Stack

- Programming Language: [To be decided]
- Version Control: Git
- LLM APIs: OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude
- Additional libraries and frameworks: [To be determined based on chosen language and specific requirements]

## 2.5 System Requirements

- Operating System: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Minimum RAM: 8GB (16GB recommended for large codebases)
- Storage: Dependent on codebase size, minimum 1GB free space
- Internet Connection: Required for LLM API interactions

This overview provides a foundation for understanding the Kompressor system. Detailed specifications for each component are covered in subsequent sections.
