# Kompressor: AI-Assisted Code Management System

## 1. Introduction

Kompressor is a tool designed to optimize codebase management and interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude or GPT. It aims to enhance code organization, documentation, and AI-assisted development processes.

## 2. System Overview

Kompressor consists of several interconnected components that work together to create a comprehensive code management and AI interaction system.

### 2.1 Core Components

1. Codebase Compiler
2. Document Generator
3. LLM Interaction Module
4. Test Management System
5. Version Control Integration

## 3. Detailed Specifications

### 3.1 Codebase Compiler

#### Purpose
To consolidate an entire codebase, including README files, into a single organized text file for LLM processing.

#### Features
- Recursive directory traversal
- File type filtering (configurable file extensions)
- Structured output generation with context headers
- AI-friendly formatting

#### Implementation
- Use a depth-first search algorithm for directory traversal
- Implement file extension whitelisting
- Generate a standardized header for each file, including its path and purpose
- Create a top-level AI prompt explaining the document structure

### 3.2 Document Generator

#### Purpose
To create and manage README files at various levels of the project hierarchy.

#### Features
- Automatic README generation for each directory
- Hierarchical documentation structure
- Cross-linking between README files
- JSON-based metadata management for easy updating and versioning

#### Implementation
- Develop templates for different types of README files (root, module, component)
- Implement a recursive function to generate READMEs for each directory
- Create a JSON schema for storing README metadata
- Develop functions to update README content based on code changes

### 3.3 LLM Interaction Module

#### Purpose
To facilitate efficient communication between the codebase and LLMs.

#### Features
- Context-aware code querying
- Refactoring suggestions
- Code explanation generation
- Feature implementation planning

#### Implementation
- Develop prompts for different types of LLM interactions (e.g., code explanation, refactoring)
- Implement a query parser to understand user intentions
- Create a response formatter to present LLM output in a developer-friendly manner

### 3.4 Test Management System

#### Purpose
To integrate test-driven development (TDD) practices with LLM assistance.

#### Features
- Test case suggestion based on code analysis
- Automatic test stub generation
- Test coverage analysis and reporting
- LLM-assisted test refinement

#### Implementation
- Develop an algorithm to analyze code and suggest appropriate test cases
- Create templates for different types of tests (unit, integration, etc.)
- Implement a test coverage analyzer
- Design prompts for LLMs to review and suggest improvements to tests

### 3.5 Version Control Integration

#### Purpose
To seamlessly integrate Kompressor with existing version control systems.

#### Features
- Git integration
- Automatic README updates based on commits
- Change tracking and documentation updates
- Branch-specific documentation management

#### Implementation
- Utilize Git hooks for automatic processes
- Develop functions to parse commit messages and update relevant documentation
- Implement branch detection and documentation switching

## 4. User Interface

Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for Kompressor with the following commands:

- `kompressor compile`: Compile the codebase into a single file
- `kompressor generate-docs`: Generate or update README files
- `kompressor query`: Interact with the LLM using the compiled codebase
- `kompressor test`: Manage and generate tests
- `kompressor sync`: Synchronize documentation with version control

## 5. Performance Considerations

- Optimize file reading and writing operations for large codebases
- Implement caching mechanisms to avoid unnecessary recompilation
- Use incremental updates where possible to minimize processing time

## 6. Security Considerations

- Implement safeguards to prevent sensitive information from being included in the compiled output
- Ensure secure communication with LLM APIs
- Provide options for local LLM integration to maintain code privacy

## 7. Future Enhancements

- GUI for easier interaction with the system
- Integration with popular IDEs as a plugin
- Support for multiple LLMs and easy switching between them
- Advanced code analytics and suggestions based on project-wide patterns

## 8. Conclusion

Kompressor aims to revolutionize how developers interact with their codebases and leverage AI assistance. By providing a comprehensive system for code organization, documentation, and LLM interaction, it has the potential to significantly improve development workflows and code quality.
