# 2.1 Core Components

Kompressor consists of five core components, each responsible for specific functionalities within the system. This section provides an overview of each component and its primary responsibilities.

## 2.1.1 Codebase Compiler

The Codebase Compiler is responsible for scanning, analyzing, and consolidating the entire project codebase into a format suitable for LLM processing.

Key Responsibilities:
- Recursive directory traversal
- File type filtering and selection
- Code parsing and structuring
- Generation of a unified, LLM-friendly representation of the codebase

## 2.1.2 Document Generator

The Document Generator automates the creation and maintenance of project documentation, particularly README files at various levels of the project hierarchy.

Key Responsibilities:
- Automatic README generation for directories
- Maintenance of a hierarchical documentation structure
- Cross-linking between documentation files
- JSON-based metadata management for documentation versioning

## 2.1.3 LLM Interaction Module

This module serves as the interface between the compiled codebase and Large Language Models, facilitating AI-assisted development tasks.

Key Responsibilities:
- Context-aware code querying
- Processing and formatting of LLM responses
- Handling of various code-related tasks (e.g., refactoring suggestions, code explanations)

## 2.1.4 Test Management System

The Test Management System integrates AI-assisted testing capabilities into the development workflow.

Key Responsibilities:
- Test case suggestion based on code analysis
- Automatic generation of test stubs
- Integration with Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices
- AI-assisted test refinement and coverage analysis

## 2.1.5 Version Control Integration

This component ensures seamless integration between Kompressor and existing version control systems, particularly Git.

Key Responsibilities:
- Synchronization of documentation with code changes
- Branch-specific documentation management
- Automated updates based on commit messages
- Integration with Git hooks for process automation

Each of these core components plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of Kompressor. The interactions between these components create a comprehensive system for AI-assisted code management and development.
